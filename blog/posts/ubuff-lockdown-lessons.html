    <h1>UBuff Lockdown – Full Send on AD Defense</h1>
    <p>This was my first time leading a team as captain, and Lockdown didn’t make it easy. Despite the chaos, we pulled off top 5 uptime, and I kept our AD services stable through some serious red team pressure.</p>
    <p>Right off the bat, I found persistent tools like TacticalRMM and MeshAgent hiding in Program Files. Scheduled tasks—literally named “Nothing to see here”—were keeping agents alive. I deleted them all, then built block rules disguised as allowed ones so red team checks wouldn’t trigger re-uploads. Smart defense beats brute force.</p>
    <p>Weirdest part? They mounted a fake DVD drive mid-comp with a Python script to silently reinstall MeshAgent. I caught it fast and shut it down. No one should be installing bootable drives during a comp, but here we are.</p>
    <p>Red Team tried to wipe everything during the final inject. My AD stayed online. DNS was scoring. I still had console access. They even left a note admitting they couldn’t break it. That made my week.</p>
    <p>Big takeaways: if it’s not scored, remove it. PowerShell can do everything. And most of all—stay calm when things break. Because they will.</p>
